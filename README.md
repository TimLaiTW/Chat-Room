# chat-room
Pure JS and Node.js chat room application.

## What the project does?
This is a simple project built with frontend, backend and database. 

User could login or register to join the chat room. Once entering the chat room, it'll displays the historical messages posted by other users and him/herself. 

The posted messages coming with the author, date and time and the messages provide more information to other users.

## Why the project is useful?
A good and easy way to start learning how to construct a full stack project.

With some useful libraries's help: 
- Socket.io: provides the communication bridge between frontend and backend.
- jQuery: makes HTML DOM manipulation much more easier. 

## How users can get started with the project?
1. To run the server, basically type `node index` on terminal/ command line. 
2. On browser, enter `localhost: 3000`. The port 3000 is defined in index.js, feel free to change it to your liking.
